                    "No 8 Mill Street is a local business born of our love for Spanish food and culture.
                    Having lived and spent many holidays in Spain and great times enjoying tapas bars, we were inspired
                    to
                    bring an authentic experience to Westport to share what we think is the authentic family way of
                    eating.

                    Our concept is to serve small dishes tapas style….. it is all about the
                    sharing and enjoyment of
                    eating and tasting some amazing flavours. Our aim is to make every customer feel at home with
                    its informal buzzy atmosphere and welcoming staff.
                    No 8 combines best quality food wines and beers. authentic preparation,
                    friendly service and
                    great prices delivered in a contemporary space with a neighbourhood vibe."
